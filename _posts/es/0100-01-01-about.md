The Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI) is a unique collaborative venture between human rights practitioners, researchers, academics, and other human rights supporters.

Our goal is to produce the first and best comprehensive set of metrics for tracking the human rights performance of countries.

Our 2018 data-set includes:
* Annual data on five economic and social rights for 120 to 180 countries (depending on the right) from 2005 to 2015.
* Pilot data on seven civil and political rights for 13 countries covering the time period from January to June 2017.

Over time we aim to extend our civil and political rights data to the rest of the world, and expand our full set of data to include additional metrics.
